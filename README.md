# Symbolic Data Partitioning

## Overview

This repository contains the code for Catalyst. It includes the entire codebase. Follow the steps below to build and run the system, and to conduct experiments.

## Building the System

To build the system, follow these steps:

1. **Build the Docker image:**

   ```bash
   docker build -t artifactimg .
2. **Run the Docker image:**
   ```bash
   docker run -it artifactimg /bin/bash

Alternatively, the system can be compiled by simply running mvn clean install. However, openSMT and approxmc need to be installed appropriately and their binaries need to be included in /resources. 

## Running Experiments

### Experiment 1: Distributed Transactions, Execution Time, Graph Size

Run the following Maven command to execute Experiment 1:

mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="1 x y"

x specifies the algorithm:
- 1 for Catalyst
- 2 for Schism

y specifies the workload:
- 1 for 1w2p
- 2 for 2w2p
- 3 for 1w5p
- 5 for 10w5p
- 7 for RUBIS

Note that to see the graph generated by the experiment in a METIS format you must open the metis.txt file generated by the previous command. The first line will contain the number of vertices and edges in the graph.
The program will print the percentage of distributed transactions and the execution time per component for our system in the console.

### Experiment 2: Throughput Deployment

Run the following Maven command to execute Experiment 2:

mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="2 x y z"

x specifies the algorithm:
- 1 for Catalyst
- 2 for Schism

y specifies the workload:
- 1 for 1w2p
- 2 for 2w2p
- 3 for 1w5p
- 5 for 10w5p
- 7 for RUBIS (2p)

z specifies the node_id (1,...) - deploy as many as the number of partitions in the experiment
